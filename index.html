        <p class="sectiondesc">Before you know what a drone could do, you should know what a drone is. A drone is basically a quadcopter (a helicopter with four propellers) with a camera mounted to it. Drones are perfect for taking aerial photography, exploring, and racing.</p>
        <p class="sectiondesc">Modern consumer drones are extremely powerful. They are capable of traveling great distances from the controller at rapid speeds. A high-spec drone can go up to 4 miles and reach speeds up to 60 mph!</p>
        <p class="sectiondesc">How do they do this? A drone is basically a flying computer. Inside, there are a multitude of sensors including a GPS, accelerometer, gyroscope, and more. The on-board processor uses these sensors so the aircraft knows exactly how it is flying. For power and flight, four brushless engines are accelerated by a high capacity Li-Po battery.</p>
        <p class="sectiondesc" style="margin-bottom:20px;">In the end, a drone uses its computer and sensors to make it simple for anyone to create footage like this ⇣</p>

  <div style="background-color:rgba(239, 238, 255, 0.99);" class="contentdiv">

    <p class="sectiontitle">So, how are drones used?</p>
    <h2>Recreation</h2>
        <p class="sectionnopic">Drones are widely used between hobbyists, kids, and people who simply want to fly. These consumers will usually buy low price drones to take cool pictures and share them with friends and family. </p>
    <h2>Photography</h2>
        <p class="sectionnopic">A drone is the perfect tool for aerial photography. Photographers love using drones because it gives them a new perspective on the world. High tier consumer drones have cameras with amazing specs and stabilization which make it so one would never know the picture was taken from a drone.</p>
    <h2>Racing</h2>
        <p class="sectionnopic">Drones built for racing are capable of performing extremely fine maneuvers and fast speeds. There are various competitions for drone racers. Most pilots who race like to build their own drone. This way they can fine-tune it to race exaclty how they want it to.</p>   
    <h2>Professional</h2>
        <p class="sectionnopic">A drone is a very useful piece of equipment for professionals. Professional drones are fitted with extremely high quality cameras that can turn 360 degrees. Pro drones are also bigger and more powerful so they can stand up to higher winds to get a perfect shot. Pro drones are used to shoot movies and TV shows and are even used by emergency services to enter dangerous areas.</p>    
    <h2>Military</h2>
        <p class="sectionnopic" style="margin-bottom:20px;">Drones used by the military are very different than consumer drones. Military drones are similar to the size of actual planes. Military drones are used to perform air raids where it would be too dangerous to send a manned aircraft. This way, no human lives are at stake.</p>

        <p class="sectiontitle">What types of drones are there?</p>
    <h2>Toy Grade</h2>
      <div style="float:right;margin-top:30px;margin-right:50px;margin-left:20px;">
        <img src="images/toygrade.png" alt="toygradedrone" style="width:200px;">
        <div class="caption">Hubsan X4 H107C: $48.99</div>
      </div>  

        <p class="sectiondesc">Toy grade aircrafts are the least expensive and simplest of the drones. These drones are great for kids because they are smaller and easier to learn. They are also great for first time pilots who are learning how to fly a drone because they are inexpensive to replace after a bad crash. Even during a crash, these drones tend to be more durable and survive longer then high grade drones. Toy grade drones usually range from $50 to $150.</p>

    <h2>Low-End Consumer Grade</h2>
        <div style="float:right;margin-top:30px;margin-right:50px;margin-left:20px;">
          <img src="images/lowconsumergrade.png" alt="consumergradedrone" style="width:200px;">
          <div class="caption">Onagofly: $399.00</div>
        </div>  

        <p class="sectiondesc">Low-End consumer grade drones are basically toy grade with a few features of high-end drones. The goal of this category is to have a small and light weight aircraft that is easy to take anywhere and that is also easy to fly. These aircrafts will usually use a smartphone as the controller. Their main purpose is to take selfies and short videos so they will not have great range or battery life. However, most are still fully loaded with advanced sensors including a GPS and vision positioning sensors. These drones will range anywhere from $200 to $400.</p>

    <h2>High-End Consumer Grade</h2>
        <div style="float:right;margin-top:30px;margin-right:50px;margin-left:20px;">
          <img src="images/highconsumergrade.png" alt="highgradedrone" style="width:200px;">
          <div class="caption">DJI Mavic Pro: $999.00</div>
        </div>  

        <p class="sectiondesc">High-End Consumer grade drones are for pilots who want to get the most out of a drone at a decent price. These aircrafts have most of the advanced features that are in hobby and professional grade drones. They are usually somewhat compact and easy to travel with. They have excellent cameras which are great for filming personal movies and taking great pictures. These drones will usually range from $500 to $1000.</p>

    <h2>Hobby Grade</h2>
        <div style="float:right;margin-top:30px;margin-right:50px;margin-left:20px;">
          <img src="images/hobbygrade.png" alt="hobbygradedrone" style="width:200px;">
          <div class="caption">DJI Phantom 4: $1,199.00</div>
        </div>  

        <p class="sectiondesc">Hobby grade drones are the most popular. These aircrafts are jam packed with professional features including incredible range and outstanding battery life. With most models featuring 4K cameras, they are great for filming for professioinal commericals and videos. They are also great for exploring large areas and reaching high altitudes as there are models with control ranges up to 4 miles. Hobby grade drones are popular because they feature almost everything a professional drone has and cost a much lower price. These drones will range from $800 to $1,300.</p>   

    <h2>Professional Grade</h2>
        <div style="float:right;margin-top:30px;margin-right:50px;margin-left:20px;">
          <img src="images/prograde.png" alt="progradedrone" style="width:200px;">
          <div class="caption">DJI Inspire 2: $2,999.00</div>
        </div>  

        <p class="sectiondesc" style="margin-bottom:100px;">Professional grade drones are the top of the line and the go-to for movie and TV studios. These aircrafts can carry professional cameras and feature extremely long battery life. Certain models of pro drones even have landing gear which can retract after takeoff. This way, the camera can spin 360 degrees without getting the legs or propellers in the way. Professional drones focus less on being consumer friendly and portable and more on getting the best possible shot. Pro drones will be over $1,600 and could cost as much as $10,000.</p>
