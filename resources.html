  <p class="sectiontitle" style="color:white;">Site Refrences</p>
    <h2 style="color:white;">Pictures that I created:</h2>
        <p class="sectionnopic" style="color:white;">Four out of the six parallax background images on the main page are photos that I took with my own drone and edited myself in Photoshop. Those images are the ones behind "What they do", "Drone Types", "Find Your Drone", and the "Site Refrences" button. The other two images used as backgrounds were taken from Unsplash.com which is a royalty free image website.</p>
        <p class="sectionnopic" style="color:white;">Three of the images in the "Drone Types" section were taken from DJI.com and the other two (the picture of the Hubsan X4 and OnagoFly) were taken from Amazon.com.</p>

    <h2 style="color:white;">Embedded Media and Rollover</h2>
        <p class="sectionnopic" style="color:white;">My embedded media is within the "What They Do" section of the website. This is an HTML5 video that I filmed myself with my own drone. The rollover image effect is also in the "What They Do" section and it is applied to the drone icon in the upper right next to the text. This image was downloaded off of Icons8.com. Icons8's policy is that their images are allowed to be used as long as they are given proper credit. </p>

    <h2 style="color:white;">My Javascript</h2>
        <p class="sectionnopic" style="color:white;">I used three different Javascript functions. The first is called "menuFunction". This function is responsible for the operation of the hamburger menu. The hamburger menu button appears when the window is too small for the navbar to fit. When the button is tapped, the function is called.This enhances the site because it allows it to support mobile devices. </p>

        <p class="sectionnopic" style="color:white;">The second function is called "playPause". This function allows the HTML5 video in the "What They Do" section to be played. The last function is called "quizFunction". This function handles the quiz feature in the "Find Your Drone" section. This enhances the site because it allows the user to interact with it and find the drone that best fits them.</p>  

    <h2 style="color:white;">About My Site</h2>
        <p class="sectionnopic" style="color:white;">The first part of my site that I feel was done well was the navigation bar. The navbar is both minimalistic and useful. It does not get in the way of any of the site content because of its' short height and transparency. The next part of my site that I feel is A-level work is the parallax scrolling. Each section is separated by a different image either of a drone or taken by one. This makes the user always feel like they are on a website about drones and also gives them a feel of what drones can do which is the purpose of the site.</p>   

        <p class="sectionnopic" style="color:white;">The third part that I feel was done well was how the website adapts to mobile devices. The navbar adapts to the small screen of a mobile device by replacing the navigation links with a hamburger menu. This way, the bar remains minimalistic and does not obstruct the site's content, but is still useful and easy to use when needed.</p>  

        <p class="sectionnopic" style="color:white;">One factor of the site that can use improvement is the speed at which the site scrolls. Sometimes scrolling through the site is laggy because of the buffering of the parallax. This sometimes makes the site more annoying to navigate. Another factor that can use improvement is the amount of video in the site. I feel that the user would enjoy more videos of different types of drone flights and it would help them have a better understanding of what a drone can do.</p>   

    <h2 style="color:white;">Extra "stuff"</h2>   
        <p class="sectionnopic" style="color:white;">The "extra" work that I added to my site is the drone "quiz" which helps the user decide what drone they should get. This uses all Javascript functions and is located in the "Find Your Drone" section of the page.</p>
